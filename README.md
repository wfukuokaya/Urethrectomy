# Oncological outcomes of prophylactic urethrectomy at the time of radical cystectomy for bladder cancer

This repository contains the R code used in the study.

In this observational study, we assessed the effect of prophylactic urethrectomy on oncological outcomes in patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer. We used data from the Japan Urological Oncology Group radical cystectomy database to compare overall survival, cancer-specific survival, and recurrence-free survival between patients who underwent radical cystectomy with or without prophylactic urethrectomy.

We did not find evidence that prophylactic urethrectomy improves oncological outcomes in patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer.
